=== Tutorial series

Contentful's https://www.contentful.com/developers/videos/learn-graphql/[Getting started with GraphQL]

. exploring endpoints
** query can have multiple queries, as long as unique lables/alias
** _Contentful_ has collection filters out-of-box (probably their resolvers)
. fetching w/ **React** usestate, useeffect, apollo
** re-watch and build 1-off react app
** (deferred) suggestion `npm audit fix --force`
** (deferred) understand `npm start` vs `yarn start`
** AJAX/`window.fetch()`: GET (read) vs POST (write but can also read)
** https://react.dev/reference/react/useState[useState] - add a state variable `let [currentVal, setterFn] = useState(initVal)`
** https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect[useEffect] - synchronize w/ external system (call once per component mount instead of every mutation)
. refactor React app using env variables
** in $PROJ_ROOT/.env properties file, `REACT_APP_*` exposed to `process.env` to keep secrets out of source (assuming gitignore excludes .env files)
** moving access_token from query-parameter to request header
. refactor app with custom hook in react
. refactor app for error handling (auth, validation)
. refactor app with React Proptypes, tailwindCSS; add fields to content model
. refactor app to include image
. refactor app w/ rich-text
** markdown URLs are hard-coded => hard to maintain/brittle
** field has json, links
** contentful provides rich-text-react-renderer, rich-text-types to simplify json=>HTML `documentToReactComponents(bio.json)`
** but still a lot of work to convert every HTML element
. `npm install --save @contentful/rich-text-types @contentful/rich-text-react-renderer`
. contentful references (multi ref to string)
. GraphQL fragments & query complexity - start by using limits on collections
** fragments '...${fragName}' (re-use)
** collections filter/linkedfrom
** query complexity <= use limit to reduce query cost; errors will share the cost/threshold if too high
. preview / query variables
** complexity of targeting preview docs (CPA token vs CDA token)
** variables can be optional/mandatory/have defaults
. server directives: conditional queries
. additional references
** https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/graphql/ Contentful's GraphQL API & extensions

==== Meta Notes

* react APIs: use relay or Apollo to manage/centralize many queries/calls
* Contentful field refactoring (to delete) in content model: disable, save, delete, save
* Contentful provides **transformation** options/filters in GraphQL queries for assets
